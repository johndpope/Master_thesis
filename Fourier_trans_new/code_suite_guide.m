%% Setting the input signal 
% take correlation function and input for correlation function and generate
% the input signal and other signal depenedent variables like sampling rate
% etc etc

%% DFT of input signal 
% Use fft and don't forget to get the frequency range as output

%% Generate random field realisation.
% Calculate the coefficients a, b and c and then use ift to generate the 
% field

%% Plotting - 
% keep this at the end. Should plot fft, generated field, correlation of  
% i/p signal, correlation of random field, average correlation of multiple
% random fields.

%% Checking for errors 
% Whether symmetry in a and b are maintained - put this as a warning in 
% random field generating function. 
% whether other conditions on a b and c are maintained
% whether the realised random field is real
% computed correlation versus correlation of input signal
% taking real instead of absolute value of spectrum
